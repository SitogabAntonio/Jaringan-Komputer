~~ Client-to-Client (C2C) in Java refers to a networking model where multiple client programs can communicate directly with each other without relying on a central server. In this model, each client acts both as a client and a server, allowing peer-to-peer communication between clients.

In Java, C2C communication can be implemented using various technologies and protocols. One common approach is to utilize Java sockets and establish direct connections between clients. Each client can create a ServerSocket to listen for incoming connections and a Socket to connect to other clients.

Here's a high-level overview of how Client-to-Client communication can be implemented in Java:

Client 1 creates a ServerSocket and starts listening for incoming connections on a specific port.
Client 2 creates a Socket and connects to Client A's IP address and port number.
Once the connection is established, both clients have input and output streams for communication.
Client 1 and Client 2 can exchange data by writing to the output streams and reading from the input streams.
Each client can act as both a sender and receiver, allowing bidirectional communication. ~
